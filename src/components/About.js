                <h1>What is Lessive?</h1>
               
                <p>Lessive is essentially the solution to those with a busy schedule that find their laundry piling up along with all the other things life throws at them. Or it can just be for those who <span>hate</span> the process of doing laundry. We also understand that laundry can be something that can be made more accessible to those who could be going through a hard time right now. Let us help you with that. <em>Lessive</em> is a laundry delivery service. You call for a delivery and we will take it to to the nearest partnering laundromat or dry cleaners for you. It's as simple as that.</p>
